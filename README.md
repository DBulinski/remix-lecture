## React Days 2021

This app has been created for React Days 2021 by Dawid Buli≈Ñski (PGS Software).

For each step of lecture there is a branch created, so you can always come back to previous section.

step/1-start-exercises

step/2-add-links-and-meta

step/3-add-loader

step/4-add-actions

step/5-add-error-and-catch-boundaries

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.
